# Feature Specification: Twitter Likes Capture Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-twitter-likes-extension`  
**Created**: 2025-07-12  
**Status**: Draft  

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Executive Summary *(mandatory)*

A Safari browser extension that automatically captures and stores Twitter/X posts when users click the like button, creating a private, searchable database of liked content for personal AI-powered analysis and associative memory retrieval.

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Users lose track of content they've liked on Twitter/X over time, making it difficult to rediscover valuable posts or identify patterns in their interests. The current platform only provides basic chronological like history without semantic search, categorization, or intelligent associations between related content.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories (must have)

- **US-001**: As a Twitter user, I want to automatically capture complete post content when I like a tweet so that I can build a private archive of my interests
  - **Happy Path**: User clicks like button ‚Üí Extension detects click ‚Üí Post content captured with screenshot and text ‚Üí Stored locally ‚Üí User sees confirmation
  - **Edge Case**: User unlikes a post - system deletes the post from database
  - **Test**: Like a tweet with text and images, verify both screenshot and text are captured in local database

- **US-002**: As a content curator, I want to capture the visual layout and formatting of posts so that the full context and presentation is preserved
  - **Happy Path**: User likes post with complex layout ‚Üí Extension screenshots visible post area ‚Üí High-quality image stored alongside text data
  - **Edge Case**: Post contains videos or dynamic content - capture what's visible at moment of like
  - **Test**: Like posts with images, polls, quote tweets, and verify visual fidelity in captured screenshots

- **US-003**: As a knowledge worker, I want to capture thread context when liking replies so that I understand the relationship between related posts
  - **Happy Path**: User navigates to thread view ‚Üí Likes reply ‚Üí Extension captures full visible thread including root and immediate parent ‚Üí Screenshots entire center column ‚Üí Stores complete thread context
  - **Edge Case**: Very long threads or deleted parent posts - capture available context and mark limitations
  - **Test**: Like a reply several levels deep in a thread, verify root post and immediate parent are captured with full thread context when available

### Secondary User Stories (nice to have)

- **US-004**: As a privacy-conscious user, I want all my liked content stored locally so that my data remains under my control
  - **Journey**: Extension operates entirely offline after initial setup ‚Üí No data sent to external services ‚Üí User can export/backup data
  - **Test**: Verify no network requests are made during capture process (except to x.com)

- **US-005**: As a researcher, I want my likes automatically clustered by topic so that I can discover patterns and related content without manual organization
  - **Journey**: Extension captures likes ‚Üí AI performs unsupervised clustering on content ‚Üí User can browse clustered groups ‚Üí Related posts surface automatically
  - **Test**: Verify clustering algorithm groups semantically similar posts together

### Critical Test Scenarios

- **Error Recovery**: Extension continues working if x.com UI changes or like button is temporarily unavailable; stores partial data when complete capture fails
- **Performance**: Capture process completes within 3 seconds without interfering with normal browsing
- **Data Integrity**: Currently liked posts are never lost; unlike operations are processed reliably

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when user clicks the like button on x.com posts
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture full text content of the liked post including author information and timestamp in any language
- **FR-003**: System MUST take a screenshot of the center column content including thread context, capturing off-screen content when possible
- **FR-004**: System MUST store captured data in local SQLite database on user's machine
- **FR-005**: System MUST work exclusively within Safari browser environment
- **FR-006**: System MUST capture thread context including root post and immediate parent when liking replies
- **FR-014**: System SHOULD capture full visible thread context when available in the DOM
- **FR-007**: System MUST capture posts with multimedia content (images, videos, polls, quote tweets)
- **FR-011**: System MUST capture only the original tweet when user likes a plain retweet
- **FR-012**: System MUST capture only the quote tweet (which includes original content) when user likes a quote tweet
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual feedback when capture is successful or fails
- **FR-015**: System MUST store partial captures (text-only or screenshot-only) when complete capture fails
- **FR-016**: System MUST retain captured data even if original post becomes private or deleted
- **FR-009**: System MUST delete posts from database when user unlikes them
- **FR-013**: System MUST treat re-likes as fresh captures (no deduplication across like/unlike cycles)
- **FR-010**: System MUST operate without sending user data to external services except necessary x.com interactions

### Key Entities

- **LikedPost**: Individual tweet/post with text content, author, timestamp, capture date
- **PostScreenshot**: Visual capture of post layout with image data and metadata
- **ThreadRelationship**: Parent-child associations between posts in conversation threads
- **CaptureSession**: Metadata about when and how content was captured

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Post capture completes within 3 seconds of like button click
- **Storage**: Efficiently stores potentially thousands of posts with screenshots locally
- **Reliability**: 99% capture success rate for supported post types
- **Security**: All data remains on user's local machine with no external transmission
- **Constraints**: Must work within Safari extension security sandbox and x.com's current DOM structure
- **Internationalization**: Must handle text capture and storage for all languages supported by x.com

---

## Integration Points *(optional - only if external systems involved)*

**External Systems**:
- **x.com/Twitter**: Read post content and detect like button interactions (read-only access to DOM)
- **Local File System**: Write access for SQLite database and screenshot storage

**Events & Notifications**:
- **Like Detected**: Triggered when user clicks like button
- **Capture Complete**: Notifies user when post successfully stored
- **Capture Failed**: Alerts user if content could not be saved

---

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Functional Validation
- [ ] All user stories pass acceptance testing
- [ ] All functional requirements work end-to-end
- [ ] Extension works consistently across different post types and thread structures

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Performance: Post capture completes within 3 seconds
- [ ] Load: System handles capturing 100+ posts per browsing session
- [ ] Error handling: Graceful degradation when x.com UI changes or content is unavailable
- [ ] Data integrity: All captured posts retrievable with complete text and visual content

### Measurable Outcomes
- [ ] User can rediscover 90% of liked content through captured data
- [ ] Capture process has minimal impact on normal Twitter browsing experience
- [ ] Database enables effective AI analysis and pattern recognition

---

## Scope & Constraints *(optional - include relevant subsections only)*

### In Scope
- Safari browser extension for x.com
- Like button interception and post capture
- Text extraction and screenshot capture
- Local SQLite database storage
- Thread relationship tracking
- Basic capture success/failure feedback

### Out of Scope
- AI analysis or pattern recognition algorithms (data preparation only)
- Cross-browser compatibility (Safari only)
- Cloud storage or synchronization
- Social sharing or collaboration features
- Advanced search interface (separate application)
- Real-time notification system
- Storage limits or automatic cleanup features
- Data export formats beyond SQLite database

### Dependencies
- Safari browser with extension support
- User access to x.com account
- Local file system write permissions
- SQLite database support

### Assumptions
- User primarily browses Twitter through Safari
- x.com maintains current DOM structure and like button behavior
- User wants to capture all likes (no selective filtering)
- User manages their own local storage capacity and cleanup as needed
- User will navigate to thread view before liking replies to enable full context capture
- Captured data represents user's legitimate interest at time of like, regardless of subsequent privacy changes

---

## Technical & Integration Risks *(optional - only if significant risks exist)*

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: x.com changes DOM structure or like button implementation
  - **Mitigation**: Design extension with flexible selectors and fallback detection methods

- **Risk**: Safari extension security restrictions limit DOM access or screenshot capabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Research Safari extension permissions and design within documented capabilities

### Integration Risks
- **Risk**: x.com implements anti-automation measures that block extension functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure extension behaves like normal user interaction, avoid suspicious patterns
