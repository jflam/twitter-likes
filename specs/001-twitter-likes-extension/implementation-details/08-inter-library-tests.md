- Direct SQLite database writes
- User feedback and status display

### Laravel Backend Library  
**Responsibilities:**
- Data processing and enrichment
- Thread relationship analysis
- Content clustering and AI preparation
- CLI interface for management and export
- Background processing and maintenance

```

## Error Propagation Tests

### Extension Error → Laravel Recovery

#### Test: Screenshot Capture Failure Recovery
```
GIVEN: Extension fails to capture screenshot but text succeeds
WHEN: Laravel processes the incomplete record
THEN:
  1. Laravel identifies missing screenshot
  2. Text-only record processed normally
  3. Status commands indicate partial capture
  4. Export functions include text data without image
```

#### Test: Database Write Failure Handling
```
GIVEN: Database locked or unavailable during extension capture
WHEN: Extension encounters write failure
THEN:
  1. Extension queues operation for retry
  2. User sees appropriate error feedback
  3. Laravel processing detects pending operations
  4. Retry mechanism completes capture when possible
```

### Laravel Error → Extension Notification

#### Test: Processing Failure Feedback
```
GIVEN: Laravel encounters error processing captured data
WHEN: Extension checks status via file queue
THEN:
  1. Error status written to shared status file
  2. Extension reads error status
  3. User notified of processing issue
  4. Retry options presented to user
```

## Performance Integration Tests
